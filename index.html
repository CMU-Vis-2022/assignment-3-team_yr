      The chart below shows the break down of what is the main cause of the air quality.

      The rationale for the design decisions: I chose the design to see what is the AQI count for the city. Then, it breaks down to the pollutant that is under certain criteria, to see what exactly is affacting the number.
    </p>
    <p>
      The goals of the visualization is to see: 1) When PM2.5 is below 10 (which is consider as good air quality), how many data points there in the city. 2) Is there data points for PM10/Ozone that is above 0?
    </p>

      The development process: the process was hard for me, especially as someone that come from a business background. It took me whole fall break to work on this. The 1st part is the hardest.
